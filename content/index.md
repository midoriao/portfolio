I am a student at {[National Institute of Informatics (NII)](https://www.nii.ac.jp/graduate/en/), [The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI)](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/)},
supervised by [Ichiro Hasuo](https://group-mmm.org/~ichiro/).

My research interests lie in the application of [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) under uncertainty.
In particular, I am currently working on [search-based testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search-based_software_engineering) on [hybrid systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_system) by [temporal logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic) and [metaheuristic optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic).
