# Sota Sato (佐藤創太)


I am a student at {[National Institute of Informatics (NII)](https://www.nii.ac.jp/graduate/en/), [The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI)](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/)},
supervised by [Ichiro Hasuo](https://group-mmm.org/~ichiro/).

*

My research interests lie in the application of the [formal methods]() under uncertainty.
Especially, I am currently working on quality assurance on hybrid (physical-computational) systems by temporal logics and metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
